	Lesson 306:
	*Access modifiers* are keywords that can be used to control the visibility of 
	fields, methods, and constructors in a class. The four access modifiers in Java 
	are: public, protected, default, and private.
	- public  // Access across packages 
	- default // If access modifier is not specified then the method is accessable 
	  ONLY within the package.  Will not be able to access functionality even if 
	  package is imported
	
	Lesson 307:
	- private // Access modifier means that cannot access method or variable outside 
	  of the class
	- protected // Access modifier means that variable or method are only accessable 
	  by child classes in external packages.  Classes of same package able to access.
